# Project Name
> In a house price prediction project, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the selling price of houses based on various features and characteristics. This project typically involves working with a dataset that includes information about different houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, amenities, and other relevant factors.

## General Information
- Our house price prediction project aims to develop a robust and accurate model for estimating the selling prices of residential properties based on various features. This predictive model will be a valuable tool for real estate professionals, homebuyers, and sellers, providing them with data-driven insights to make informed decisions in the real estate market.

- The real estate market is dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors such as location, size, amenities, and market trends. Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers, enabling them to set reasonable expectations, negotiate effectively, and make informed investment decisions. This project leverages machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that captures the complex relationships between different property features and their corresponding market values.

- The primary business problem addressed by this project is the challenge of determining fair and competitive prices for residential properties. Sellers often struggle to set appropriate listing prices, risking either prolonged market presence or underselling. Buyers, on the other hand, face the challenge of assessing fair value amidst a vast array of property listings. Our model aims to mitigate these challenges, providing a reliable tool for establishing accurate house prices based on key property attributes.

- For this project, we are utilizing a comprehensive dataset sourced from a combination of real estate databases, public records, and online property listings. The dataset includes information such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, location details, amenities, and historical sales data. It is a rich and diverse collection of features that allows our model to learn and generalize patterns, ensuring robust predictions.
